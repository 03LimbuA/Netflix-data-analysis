# Netflix-data-analysis

This data analysis project, inspired by and following the tutorial of Youtube Channel 
The dataset source: [Kaggle Netflix Movies and TV Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)

For this data analysis project, I used Google Colab, leveraging its Jupyter Notebook interface to write and execute Python code. This setup allowed me to analyse the data interactively and visualise the results from the analysis.
